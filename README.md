# Stock_Market_Trend_Prediction_Using_LSTM
This repository is dedicated to predicting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The project aims to forecast future stock prices by analyzing historical market data, providing insights that can help investors and traders make informed decisions.

## Key Features :
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Efficient gathering and cleaning of historical stock price data to ensure high-quality input for the model.
- LSTM Model Implementation: Utilization of LSTM networks, which are well-suited for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Training the LSTM model on preprocessed data and evaluating its performance using various metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Prediction Visualization: Graphical representation of the model's predictions compared to actual stock prices to facilitate easy interpretation of results.

## Contents :
- Data: Scripts for collecting and preprocessing stock market data.
- Model: Code for building, training, and evaluating the LSTM model.
